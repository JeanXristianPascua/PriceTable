# Price Table

## Project Overview
This project is a simple and elegant web page that displays different pricing plans for a service or product. It offers three tiers: Personal, Small Team, and Enterprise. Each tier has unique features and pricing to cater to different types of users. The design is clean, responsive, and user-friendly.

## Technology Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the web page and making it responsive.
- **Google Fonts**: For custom fonts to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used in the pricing plans (assuming based on common practice).

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts seamlessly for different screen sizes.
- **Pricing Plans**: Three distinct pricing plans with specific features:
  - **Personal**: Includes custom domains and sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity.
  - **Small Team**: Never sleeps and supports multiple workers for more powerful apps.
  - **Enterprise**: Dedicated resources and simple horizontal scalability.
- **Call-to-Action Buttons**: Each plan has a sign-up or free trial button to engage users.
- **Hover Effects**: Buttons change color on hover to improve user interaction.
- **Clean Layout**: Uses a modern, clean design with a consistent color scheme.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the pricing plans.
2. Modify the `app.css` file to change styles or adjust the layout as needed.
3. Update the `index.html` file to add more features or modify existing ones.

## Future Enhancements
- Add JavaScript for dynamic interactions.
- Integrate with a backend to handle user sign-ups.
- Add more pricing plans or customize existing ones further.
